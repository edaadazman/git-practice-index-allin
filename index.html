      All In
    </h2>
    <p>
      AllIn is a platform designed for university students to simplify hosting and participating in poker games.
      Inspired by the growing poker scene on campuses, AllIn eliminates the hassle of scheduling games across
      participants with diverse scheduling constraints, managing a waitlist and recruiting last-minute participants,
      handling small financial exchanges, and tracking game stats like wins, losses, and money earned. With features
      tailored to enhance the social gaming experience, AllIn allows hosts to focus on having fun rather than stressing
      over logistics and players to make sound financial decisions, including deciding when they can replace their
      on-campus job with poker earnings! With a web-based prototype currently developed, BUPoker Club aims to expand its
      reach with a mobile application.
